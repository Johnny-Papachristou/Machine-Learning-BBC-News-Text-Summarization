In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda. But the Commission report says that, in most EU countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.\\n\\nOnly the UK, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU, the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. Next week, the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\",\n          \"BBC web search aids odd queries\\n\\nThe BBC's online search engine was used a record amount in 2004, helping with enquires both simple and strange.\\n\\nMore than 277 million enquiries were made, asking for informaton of a wide range of subjects. The most requested search terms of 2004 included games, EastEnders, CBBC, John Peel, Harry Potter and Olympics. But there were many strange enquiries, including: what is a dog?, how do you say basketball? and what is the biggest collection of naval fluff? The search engine works by matching key words typed in to different web pages but many people still type in natural language questions. Here are some of the strangest queries of 2004 - spelling and grammar errors left untouched - and their possible solutions:\\n\\n\\n - How to fold a serviette like an elf's boot? \\n \\n\\n\\n - How do I structure a French letter? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is better one long vacation each year or several short vacations throughout the year? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is so special about the Swiss? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What are the contemporary issue in nurses? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is the number 4 in this number 40052308090? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is up? \\n \\n\\n\\n - What is the name of James Martin's dog? \\n \\n\\nSearch engines are key to the way people use the internet. Companies such as Google have become of paramount importance as they dictate how people travel through websites while online.\",\n          \"Serena becomes world number two\\n\\nSerena Williams has moved up five places to second in the world rankings after her Australian Open win.\\n\\nWilliams won her first Grand Slam title since 2003 with victory over Lindsay Davenport, the world number one. Men's champion Marat Safin remains fourth in the ATP rankings while beaten finalist Lleyton Hewitt replaces Andy Roddick as world number two. Roger Federer retains top spot, but Safin has overtaken Hewitt to become the new leader of the Champions Race. Alicia Molik, who lost a three-set thriller against Davenport in the quarter-finals, is in the women's top 10 for the first time in her career. Her rise means Australia have a player in the top 10 of the men's and women's rankings for the first time in 21 years. And Britain's Elena Baltacha, who qualified and then reached the third round, has risen to 120 in the world - a leap of 65 places and her highest ranking yet.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["doc = df[df.labels == 'business']['text'].sample(random_state=42)"],"metadata":{"id":"u5nc4qSnDKzn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720688883437,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny papachristou","userId":"01529305342771824193"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def wrap(x):\n","  return textwrap.fill(x, replace_whitespace=False, fix_sentence_endings=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"8MNYZ4JaDLzJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720688891636,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny papachristou","userId":"01529305342771824193"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Split to sentences\n","sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(doc.iloc[0].split(\"\\n\", 1)[1])\n","print(len(sentences))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hqoqlhECAt_J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720688921131,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":248,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny papachristou","userId":"01529305342771824193"}},"outputId":"808f1734-9172-4fb1-b1ef-754526d5125e"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["17\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Compute TF-IDF\n","vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n","X = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences)\n","print(X.shape)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"26mpdhc_A7A7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720688922503,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Johnny papachristou","userId":"01529305342771824193"}},"outputId":"0039463b-4dc8-4d9c-9602-1bc6248fc55f"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["(17, 199)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Compute scores\n","non_zero_averages = []\n","\n","# Iterate through each row in the TF-IDF matrix\n","for i in range(X.shape[0]):\n","    row = X[i]\n","    #
